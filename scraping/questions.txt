1	admin	There are at most eight servers in a data center. Each server has got a capacity/memory limit. There can be at most 8 tasks that need to be scheduled on those servers. Each task requires certain capacity/memory to run, and each server can handle multiple tasks as long as the capacity limit is not hit. Write a program to see if all of the given tasks can be scheduled or not on the servers?  Ex: Servers capacity limits: 8, 16, 8, 32 Tasks capacity needs: 18, 4, 8, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8 For this example, the program should say 'true'.  Ex2: Server capacity limits: 1, 3 Task capacity needs: 4 For this example, program should return false.  Got some idea that this needs to be solved using dynamic programming concept, but could not figure out exact solution.	126	2014-12-09 16:17:56			1

10	admin	Q: If you have all the companies that are traded, and live inputs are coming of which company is being traded and what is the volume, how do you maintain the data, so that you can carry out operation of giving the top 10 most traded companies by volume of shares most efficiently. A: I juggled between Hash Map and Max Heap. I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time. Even that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy. He stressed that at every trade, at most, only 1 company will change in my top 10. This hit me and got me to the correct answer that we keep all actual data in HashMap, but also maintain a MinHeap of 10 most traded company.	41	2014-12-09 16:17:58			19

14	admin	Rearrange an array using swap with 0.  You have two arrays src, tgt, containing two permutations of the numbers 0..n-1. You would like to rearrange src so that it equals tgt. The only allowed operations is swap a number with 0, e.g. {1,0,2,3} -> {1,3,2,0} (swap 3 with 0). Write a program that prints to stdout the list of required operations.  Practical application:  Imagine you have a parking place with n slots and n-1 cars numbered from 1..n-1. The free slot is represented by 0 in the problem. If you want to rearrange the cars, you can only move one car at a time into the empty slot, which is equivalent to swap a number with 0.

Each rectangle denoted by bottom left & top right corner coordinates. 2) set P of n2 points - let n = n1 + n2  For each point 'p' in set P, find the rectangle 'r_p' in set R that contains 'p'. If 'p' is not enclosed by any rectangle, then 'r_p' is undefined. Otherwise, 'r_p' is unique because of the non-overlapping set.  Goal: come up with a divide-and-conquer pseudocode to solve the general problem in O(n(logn)^2) time.  Asked about points that are on the edge of the rectangle, and they said it was up to me whether to include those or not, just a matter of "<" vs "<=", etc. comparisons. Because it's just pseudocode they were looking for, they were not too concerned with the actual structure of the return value, just that the D&C algorithm showed the logic.  Struggled with it for awhile and they simplified the problem to a ~special case with the constraint where all rectangles of R intersected a horizontal line 'L', and instead give a O(nlogn) algorithm to solve the same problem. I suspect this would've been a subproblem/subroutine of the more general case, but again got a bit lost.	106	2014-12-09 16:18:12			1

69	admin	You are given a sequence of black and white horses, and a set of k stables numbered 1 to k. You have to accommodate the horses into the stables in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:  a. You fill the horses into the stables preserving the order of horses. For instance, you cannot put for horse 1 into stable 2 and horse 2 into stable 1. You have to preserve the ordering of horses.  b. No stable should be empty and No horse should be left unaccommodated.  c. Take the product (number of white horses * number of black horses) for each stable and take the sum of all these products. This value should be the minimum among all possible accommodation arrangements.	17	2014-12-09 16:18:24			None

76	admin	Given an array A of N integers, we draw N discs in a 2D plane such that the I-th disc is centered on (0,I) and has a radius of A[I]. We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J = K and J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point. Write a function: int number_of_disc_intersections(int A[], int N); that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of pairs of intersecting discs. For example, given N=6 and: A[0] = 1 A[1] = 5 A[2] = 2 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 4 A[5] = 0 intersecting discs appear in eleven pairs of elements: 0 and 1, 0 and 2, 0 and 4, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 1 and 5, 2 and 3, 2 and 4, 3 and 4, 4 and 5. so the function should return 11. The function should return 1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [0..10,000,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2147483647]. Complexity: expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N)); expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.	126	2014-12-09 16:18:25			None

78	admin	Given two (dictionary) words as Strings, determine if they are isomorphic. Two words are called isomorphic if the letters in one word can be remapped to get the second word. Remapping a letter means replacing all occurrences of it with another letter while the ordering of the letters remains unchanged. No two letters may map to the same letter, but a letter may map to itself.  Example: given "foo", "app"; returns true we can map 'f' -> 'a' and 'o' -> 'p' given "bar", "foo"; returns false we can't map both 'a' and 'r' to 'o'  given "turtle", "tletur"; returns true we can map 't' -> 't', 'u' -> 'l', 'r' -> 'e', 'l' -> 'u', 'e' -'r'  given "ab", "ca"; returns true we can map 'a' -> 'c', 'b'	198	2014-12-09 16:18:25			19

80	admin	Given a string (1-d array) , find if there is any sub-sequence that repeats itself. Here, sub-sequence can be a non-contiguous pattern, with the same relative order.  Eg:  1. abab <------yes, ab is repeated 2. abba <---- No, a and b follow different order 3. acbdaghfb <-------- yes there is a followed by b at two places 4. abcdacb <----- yes a followed by b twice  The above should be applicable to ANY TWO (or every two) characters in the string and optimum over time.  In the sense, it should be checked for every pair of characters in the string.	126	2014-12-09 16:18:25			1

84	admin	Two finite, strictly increasing, integer sequences are given. Any common integer between the two sequences constitute an intersection point. Take for example the following two sequences where intersection points are printed in bold: First= 3 5 7 9 20 25 30 40 55 56 57 60 62 Second= 1 4 7 11 14 25 44 47 55 57 100 You can walk over these two sequences in the following way: 1. You may start at the beginning of any of the two sequences. Now start moving forward. 2. At each intersection point, you have the choice of either continuing with the same sequence youre currently on, or switching to the other sequence. The objective is finding a path that produces the maximum sum of data you walked over. In the above example, the largest possible sum is 450 which is the result of adding 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 25, 44, 47, 55, 56, 57, 60, and 62  this is the same problem which I saw in SPOJ Problem Set	17	2014-12-09 16:18:26			1

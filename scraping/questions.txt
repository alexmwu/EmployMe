For example, List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24, 26] List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20] List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30]  The smallest range here would be [20, 24] as it contains 24 from list 1, 20 from list 2, and 22 from list 3.	126	2014-12-10 11:30:14			1		
2	admin	Pots of gold game: Two players A & B. There are pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins (the players can see how many coins are there in each gold pot - perfect information). They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line. The winner is the player which has a higher number of coins at the end. The objective is to "maximize" the number of coins collected by A, assuming B also plays optimally. A starts the game.  The idea is to find an optimal strategy that makes A win knowing that B is playing optimally as well. How would you do that?  At the end I was asked to code this strategy!	126	2014-12-10 11:30:14			1

40	admin	Q: If you have all the companies that are traded, and live inputs are coming of which company is being traded and what is the volume, how do you maintain the data, so that you can carry out operation of giving the top 10 most traded companies by volume of shares most efficiently. A: I juggled between Hash Map and Max Heap. I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time. Even that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy. He stressed that at every trade, at most, only 1 company will change in my top 10. This hit me and got me to the correct answer that we keep all actual data in HashMap, but also maintain a MinHeap of 10 most traded company.	41	2014-12-10 11:33:00			19

44	admin	Rearrange an array using swap with 0.  You have two arrays src, tgt, containing two permutations of the numbers 0..n-1. You would like to rearrange src so that it equals tgt. The only allowed operations is swap a number with 0, e.g. {1,0,2,3} -> {1,3,2,0} (swap 3 with 0). Write a program that prints to stdout the list of required operations.  Practical application:  Imagine you have a parking place with n slots and n-1 cars numbered from 1..n-1. The free slot is represented by 0 in the problem. If you want to rearrange the cars, you can only move one car at a time into the empty slot, which is equivalent to swap a number with 0.

You will given each bomb's value and the 'effect range',and you need calculate the max value you can get. eg. n=3 index 0's bomb' v is 2,range is 0(will not effect others).and v[1]=1,r[1]=1,v[2]=3,r[2]=1; this case's max value is 5.(detonate the 0's and than the 2's).

83	admin	As input, you are given two sets: 1) set R of n1 non-overlapping rectangles, whose sides are parallel to the x- and y-axes (ie: not rotated rectangles). Each rectangle denoted by bottom left & top right corner coordinates. 2) set P of n2 points - let n = n1 + n2  For each point 'p' in set P, find the rectangle 'r_p' in set R that contains 'p'. If 'p' is not enclosed by any rectangle, then 'r_p' is undefined. Otherwise, 'r_p' is unique because of the non-overlapping set.  Goal: come up with a divide-and-conquer pseudocode to solve the general problem in O(n(logn)^2) time.  Asked about points that are on the edge of the rectangle, and they said it was up to me whether to include those or not, just a matter of "<" vs "<=", etc. comparisons. Because it's just pseudocode they were looking for, they were not too concerned with the actual structure of the return value, just that the D&C algorithm showed the logic.  Struggled with it for awhile and they simplified the problem to a ~special case with the constraint where all rectangles of R intersected a horizontal line 'L', and instead give a O(nlogn) algorithm to solve the same problem. I suspect this would've been a subproblem/subroutine of the more general case, but again got a bit lost.	106	2014-12-10 11:35:43			1

Write a function: int number_of_disc_intersections(int A[], int N); that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of pairs of intersecting discs. For example, given N=6 and: A[0] = 1 A[1] = 5 A[2] = 2 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 4 A[5] = 0 intersecting discs appear in eleven pairs of elements: 0 and 1, 0 and 2, 0 and 4, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 1 and 5, 2 and 3, 2 and 4, 3 and 4, 4 and 5. so the function should return 11.

1	admin	You have k lists of sorted integers. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.  For example, List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24, 26] List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20] List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30]  The smallest range here would be [20, 24] as it contains 24 from list 1, 20 from list 2, and 22 from list 3.	126	2014-12-10 08:23:15			1		
2	admin	Pots of gold game: Two players A & B. There are pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins (the players can see how many coins are there in each gold pot - perfect information). They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line. The winner is the player which has a higher number of coins at the end. The objective is to "maximize" the number of coins collected by A, assuming B also plays optimally. A starts the game.  The idea is to find an optimal strategy that makes A win knowing that B is playing optimally as well. How would you do that?  At the end I was asked to code this strategy!	126	2014-12-10 08:23:15			1		
3	admin	A k-palindrome is a string which transforms into a palindrome on removing at most k characters.  Given a string S, and an interger K, print "YES" if S is a k-palindrome; otherwise print "NO".

8	admin	There is an island which is represented by square matrix NxN. A person on the island is standing at any given co-ordinates (x,y). He can move in any direction one step right, left, up, down on the island. If he steps outside the island, he dies.  Let island is represented as (0,0) to (N-1,N-1) (i.e NxN matrix) & person is standing at given co-ordinates (x,y). He is allowed to move n steps on the island (along the matrix). What is the probability that he is alive after he walks n steps on the island?

2	admin	Pots of gold game: Two players A & B. There are pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins (the players can see how many coins are there in each gold pot - perfect information). They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line. The winner is the player which has a higher number of coins at the end. The objective is to "maximize" the number of coins collected by A, assuming B also plays optimally. A starts the game.  The idea is to find an optimal strategy that makes A win knowing that B is playing optimally as well. How would you do that?  At the end I was asked to code this strategy!	126	2014-12-09 16:31:57			1

A: I juggled between Hash Map and Max Heap. I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time. Even that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy. He stressed that at every trade, at most, only 1 company will change in my top 10. This hit me and got me to the correct answer that we keep all actual data in HashMap, but also maintain a MinHeap of 10 most traded company.	None	2014-12-09 16:32:16			19

83	admin	As input, you are given two sets: 1) set R of n1 non-overlapping rectangles, whose sides are parallel to the x- and y-axes (ie: not rotated rectangles). Each rectangle denoted by bottom left & top right corner coordinates. 2) set P of n2 points - let n = n1 + n2  For each point 'p' in set P, find the rectangle 'r_p' in set R that contains 'p'. If 'p' is not enclosed by any rectangle, then 'r_p' is undefined. Otherwise, 'r_p' is unique because of the non-overlapping set.  Goal: come up with a divide-and-conquer pseudocode to solve the general problem in O(n(logn)^2) time.  Asked about points that are on the edge of the rectangle, and they said it was up to me whether to include those or not, just a matter of "<" vs "<=", etc. comparisons. Because it's just pseudocode they were looking for, they were not too concerned with the actual structure of the return value, just that the D&C algorithm showed the logic.  Struggled with it for awhile and they simplified the problem to a ~special case with the constraint where all rectangles of R intersected a horizontal line 'L', and instead give a O(nlogn) algorithm to solve the same problem. I suspect this would've been a subproblem/subroutine of the more general case, but again got a bit lost.	None	2014-12-09 16:32:45			None

Also they might get hashed to same location as well as we might run out of main memory  2) Okay you are out of main memory , How will you scale this program me: I will create buckets of HashTable lets say 26 buckets for one for each alphabet and would put them on different machines  3) Lets say you are out of memory on those machines too me: Okay I need to put them on secondary storage . Here we can have fileSystem or Database . I chose database . I will create simple DB schema of BucketNumber and word .  I will use buckets on main memory as cache , if we are not able to find a word in the bucket then query databse with bucket number and words then remove the least number times looked up word (every time we lookup a word we increament the count i.e value in key,value pair on hashtable) from that bucket and add this word .  I mentioned that bottleneck in this case will be every time a word is not present we need to query DB which usually has high latency which will result into performance hit  4) Lets say we are okay with latency but what if we are getting inserting words between that are only between only in two buckets ex. words starting from a and b only.

Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.  b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.  All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.	None	2014-12-09 16:34:08			41

231	admin	There is a fictional company called fooBar in fooLand. The CEO of fooBar, fooMan, directs all managers to minimize the total hike that they give to employees, while ensuring that the hike is fair to them. Usually, this is done by giving more hike to employees who are rated better. So, for example, if an employee is rated 2 and is given hike 3x, an employee rated 3 should be given a hike greater than 3x. Hikes are always in multiples of x only and the minimum hike to be given to any employee is x.  This year, however, a wicked manager, barMan comes up with a brilliant strategy. He assumes that each employee would get to know the hike of only the two employees who sit next to him (one on the left, one on the right). And therefore, he reasons(using whole of his analytical left brain), that as long as he could make hikes fair for each employee with respect to the two employees that sit next to him, he would fulfill the dual objective of being "fair" as well as minimizing the total hike given. Just for clarification, the employees of each team sit in one big line.  barMan hires you to calculate the hike to be given to each employee. Over to you. You are supposed to come up with the total hike number that will excite barMan and make him roll on the floor laughing. You are given that no two employee sitting next to each other would have a common rating.  Input:  The order of rating of each employee should be in the order in which they sit. First line will be the value of x. The second line will be the number of employees 'n'. The next 'n' lines specify the rating of each employee. Rating can be integers from 1 to 105. (weird, right?)  1 <= n <= 105. 1 <= x <= 104.  Sample input 1:  10 4 1 4 6 2  Output: 70  Why? If we have the hikes as first employee gets 10, second gets 20, third gets 30 and fourth gets 10, we satisfy all our constraints.	None	2014-12-09 16:34:32			None

235	admin	Starting at the 0 (zero) index, you need to "jump" through a one-dimensional array (zero based index) of true/false values. True is a place you can land on (if desired) and false is a place you must jump over (cannot land on). The array can be very very long.  Your "velocity" indicates how many spots (or array indexes) you advance with every jump. For example, if you have a velocity of 2 and are currently at index 4, after the jump, you will be at index 6. Before each jump you can increase your velocity by 1, decrease your velocity by 1, or keep the same velocity. You can only go forwards.  You start at index 0 (zero), with a velocity of 1. This means that for the very first jump, you can keep the same velocity and move to index 1, or increase velocity by 1 (to a velocity of 2) to move to index 2. On this first jump, you can't decrease your velocity as that would make your velocity 0 (zero) and you wouldn't move. Now that you've jumped, you can again increase, decrease, or keep your velocity the same, then jump again.  As an example, let's say you increased your velocity to 2 and jumped. You're now at index 2 with a velocity of 2. You can: 1) decrease your velocity to 1 and jump to index 3. 2) keep your velocity at 2 and jump to index 4. 3) increase your velocity to 3 and jump to index 5.  Remember, you can only and on an index if it's "true". You are successful if you can get past the last index.

369	admin	Engineers at Google have decided to call any integer (+ve, -ve or 0) that is divisible by at least one of the single digit primes (2, 3, 5, 7) as Walprimes. Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = "011". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets. For the first data set (5 points) - 1 For the second data set (10 points) - 1 For the third data set (15 points) - 1	None	2014-12-09 16:35:20			None

413	admin	A prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous part of S. A suffix of the string S is any trailing contiguous part of S. For example, "c" and "cod" are prefixes, and "ty" and "ity" are suffixes of the string "codility". For simplicity, we require prefixes and suffixes to be non-empty and shorter than the whole string S. A border of a string S is any string that is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, "cut" is a border of a string "cutletcut", and a string "barbararhubarb" has two borders: "b" and "barb". We are looking for such borders of S that have at least three non-overlapping occurrences; that is, for some string that occurs as a prefix, as a suffix and elsewhere in between. For example, for S = "barbararhubarb", the only such string is "b". In this problem we consider only strings that consist of lower-case English letters (az).

447	admin	Problem Link:https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/4214486/dashboard#s=p1  At new years party there is a pyramidal arrangement of glasses for wine. For example, at the top level, there would just be one glass, at the second level there would be three, then 6 and then 10 and so on and so forth like the following image  .  The glasses are numbered using 2 numbers, L and N. L represents the level of the glass and N represents the number in that level. Numbers in a given level are as follows:  Level 1: 1  Level 2: 1 2 3  Level 3: 1 2 3 4 5 6  Level 4: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10   Each glass can hold 250ml of wine. The bartender comes and starts pouring wine in the top glass(The glass numbered L = 1 and N = 1) from bottles each of capacity 750ml.  As wine is poured in the glasses, once a glass gets full, it overflows equally into the 3 glasses on the next level below it and touching it, without any wine being spilled outside. It doesn't overflow to the glasses on the same level beside it. It also doesn't overflow to the any level below next level (directly).  For example: When the glass of L = 2 and N = 2 overflows, the water will overflow to glasses of L = 3 and N = 2, 4, 5.  Once that the bartender is done pouring B bottles, figure out how much quantity in ml of wine is present in the glass on level L with glass number N. Input  The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three integers, B, L, N, B is the number of bottles the bartender pours and L is the glass level in the pyramid and N is the number of the glass in that level. Output  For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the quantity of wine in ml in that glass.	126	2014-12-09 16:36:29			1		
448	admin	A quadra tree is a tree where each node has atmost 4 child nodes(similar to a binary tree which has atmost 2 child nodes).  A monitor screen (black and white) is represented by a qudra tree in the following way:  case 1: If the entire screen is white then the value in the root node is white. similarly if the entire screen is black then the root stores black. case 2: If the screen is neither completely black nor white then the screen is divided into 4 quadrants and the node has 4 child nodes each representing one of the quadrants.( the screen is recursively divided into subscreens).  Now given two screens represented by two quadra trees, return a quadra tree which represents the overlapping of the two screens.( assume when white and white overlaps results in white,black and white overlap results in black , black and black overlap results in black). algo and code both have to be given.	219	2014-12-09 16:36:29			None

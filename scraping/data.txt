2	admin	Pots of gold game: Two players A & B. There are pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins (the players can see how many coins are there in each gold pot - perfect information). They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line. The winner is the player which has a higher number of coins at the end. The objective is to "maximize" the number of coins collected by A, assuming B also plays optimally. A starts the game.  The idea is to find an optimal strategy that makes A win knowing that B is playing optimally as well. How would you do that?  At the end I was asked to code this strategy!	0	0

40	admin	Q: If you have all the companies that are traded, and live inputs are coming of which company is being traded and what is the volume, how do you maintain the data, so that you can carry out operation of giving the top 10 most traded companies by volume of shares most efficiently. A: I juggled between Hash Map and Max Heap. I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time. Even that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy. He stressed that at every trade, at most, only 1 company will change in my top 10. This hit me and got me to the correct answer that we keep all actual data in HashMap, but also maintain a MinHeap of 10 most traded company.	0	0

44	admin	Rearrange an array using swap with 0.  You have two arrays src, tgt, containing two permutations of the numbers 0..n-1. You would like to rearrange src so that it equals tgt. The only allowed operations is swap a number with 0, e.g. {1,0,2,3} -> {1,3,2,0} (swap 3 with 0). Write a program that prints to stdout the list of required operations.  Practical application:  Imagine you have a parking place with n slots and n-1 cars numbered from 1..n-1. The free slot is represented by 0 in the problem. If you want to rearrange the cars, you can only move one car at a time into the empty slot, which is equivalent to swap a number with 0.  Example: src={1,0,2,3}; tgt={0,2,3,1};	0	0

83	admin	As input, you are given two sets: 1) set R of n1 non-overlapping rectangles, whose sides are parallel to the x- and y-axes (ie: not rotated rectangles). Each rectangle denoted by bottom left & top right corner coordinates. 2) set P of n2 points - let n = n1 + n2  For each point 'p' in set P, find the rectangle 'r_p' in set R that contains 'p'. If 'p' is not enclosed by any rectangle, then 'r_p' is undefined. Otherwise, 'r_p' is unique because of the non-overlapping set.  Goal: come up with a divide-and-conquer pseudocode to solve the general problem in O(n(logn)^2) time.  Asked about points that are on the edge of the rectangle, and they said it was up to me whether to include those or not, just a matter of "<" vs "<=", etc. comparisons. Because it's just pseudocode they were looking for, they were not too concerned with the actual structure of the return value, just that the D&C algorithm showed the logic.  Struggled with it for awhile and they simplified the problem to a ~special case with the constraint where all rectangles of R intersected a horizontal line 'L', and instead give a O(nlogn) algorithm to solve the same problem. I suspect this would've been a subproblem/subroutine of the more general case, but again got a bit lost.	0	0

106	admin	Given an array A of N integers, we draw N discs in a 2D plane such that the I-th disc is centered on (0,I) and has a radius of A[I]. We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J = K and J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point. Write a function: int number_of_disc_intersections(int A[], int N); that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of pairs of intersecting discs. For example, given N=6 and: A[0] = 1 A[1] = 5 A[2] = 2 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 4 A[5] = 0 intersecting discs appear in eleven pairs of elements: 0 and 1, 0 and 2, 0 and 4, 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 1 and 5, 2 and 3, 2 and 4, 3 and 4, 4 and 5. so the function should return 11. The function should return 1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [0..10,000,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2147483647].

Here we can have fileSystem or Database . I chose database . I will create simple DB schema of BucketNumber and word .  I will use buckets on main memory as cache , if we are not able to find a word in the bucket then query databse with bucket number and words then remove the least number times looked up word (every time we lookup a word we increament the count i.e value in key,value pair on hashtable) from that bucket and add this word .  I mentioned that bottleneck in this case will be every time a word is not present we need to query DB which usually has high latency which will result into performance hit  4) Lets say we are okay with latency but what if we are getting inserting words between that are only between only in two buckets ex. words starting from a and b only.

First sorting, and then picking smallest and largest to fall in set 1, and picking 2nd smallest and 2nd largest to fall in set 2.  I was asked to prove which I failed :(	0	0				
165	admin	You are given a dictionary, in the form of a file that contains one word per line. E.g., abacus deltoid gaff giraffe microphone reef qar You are also given a collection of letters. E.g., {a, e, f, f, g, i, r, q}. The task is to find the longest word in the dictionary that can be spelled with the collection of letters. For example, the correct answer for the example values above is giraffe. (Note that reef is not a possible answer, because the set of letters contains only one e.)	0	0

175	admin	There are N floors and N persons each one is tagged with some random unique number between 1 to N(represents floor number). We have a lift which can accommodate one person at a time. Every person is in some random floor. Initially lift is at floor 1 and all floors have single person. Problem here is.. we have to move the persons to their corresponding floor with minimum travelled distance of lift. Restriction : Lift can have at most one person at a time.  One more thing we have to think of is .. At a time, we can keep more than one person in a floor.. means, we don't necessarily need to take the person out from the floor if we keep another person on the same floor.	0	0

177	admin	I Got this Crazy Question on PHONE INTERVIEW AT GOOGLE:  Design and implement a class to generate random numbers in an arbitrary probability distribution given by an array of integer weights, i.e. for int[] w return a number, n, from 0 to w.length - 1 with probability w[n] / sum(w). Using an existing random number generator with a uniform distribution is permitted.  Example distribution: w = 1, 2, 3, 2, 1  Example probabilities: w / sum = 1/9, 2/9, 1/3, 2/9, 1/9  Example results: n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4  Documentation:  Class java.util.Random  public int nextInt(int n)  Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive), drawn from this random number generator's sequence. The general contract of nextInt is that one int value in the specified range is pseudorandomly generated and returned. All n possible int values are produced with (approximately) equal probability.  Parameters: n - the bound on the random number to be returned. Must be positive. Returns: the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive) from this random number generator's sequence Throws: IllegalArgumentException - if n is not positive	0	0

188	admin	Had my first and second phone interview with Amazon. I was dropped. This site has been a great help towards my preparation and most questions are based on what you find here. Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.  b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.  All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.	0	0

Each player has to replace the number n written on the board by n-2^k (for some k >= 0 such that 2^k < n)?  Also the number n-2^k has to be as beautiful as n (The beauty of a number depends on the number of one's in its binary representation). The player loses the game when he can't select any such k.

193	admin	There are exactly N advertising boards on the highway. Now a company want to advertise on some of these advertising boards (each advertising board costs some money).  Company strategy is that, they want at least 'K' advertisement should be there among M consecutive advertising boards. But at the same time Company want to pay minimum for its advertisement.  Now, what is the total number of ways Company can advertise meeting its minimum cost strategy.  Also 1 <= K <= M <= 50 and M <= N <= 10^9  As for Example: N = 3, M = 2, K = 1 ==> there is only one way for minimum cost, ie. 0C0 , where '0' denotes No company advertisement, and 'C' denotes company advertisement board.

1	admin	Pots of gold game: Two players A & B. There are pots of gold arranged in a line, each containing some gold coins (the players can see how many coins are there in each gold pot - perfect information). They get alternating turns in which the player can pick a pot from one of the ends of the line. The winner is the player which has a higher number of coins at the end. The objective is to "maximize" the number of coins collected by A, assuming B also plays optimally. A starts the game.  The idea is to find an optimal strategy that makes A win knowing that B is playing optimally as well. How would you do that?  At the end I was asked to code this strategy!	0	0

40	admin	Q: If you have all the companies that are traded, and live inputs are coming of which company is being traded and what is the volume, how do you maintain the data, so that you can carry out operation of giving the top 10 most traded companies by volume of shares most efficiently. A: I juggled between Hash Map and Max Heap. I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time. Even that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy. He stressed that at every trade, at most, only 1 company will change in my top 10. This hit me and got me to the correct answer that we keep all actual data in HashMap, but also maintain a MinHeap of 10 most traded company.	0	0

44	admin	Rearrange an array using swap with 0.  You have two arrays src, tgt, containing two permutations of the numbers 0..n-1. You would like to rearrange src so that it equals tgt. The only allowed operations is swap a number with 0, e.g. {1,0,2,3} -> {1,3,2,0} (swap 3 with 0). Write a program that prints to stdout the list of required operations.  Practical application:  Imagine you have a parking place with n slots and n-1 cars numbered from 1..n-1. The free slot is represented by 0 in the problem. If you want to rearrange the cars, you can only move one car at a time into the empty slot, which is equivalent to swap a number with 0.  Example: src={1,0,2,3}; tgt={0,2,3,1};	0	0

83	admin	As input, you are given two sets: 1) set R of n1 non-overlapping rectangles, whose sides are parallel to the x- and y-axes (ie: not rotated rectangles). Each rectangle denoted by bottom left & top right corner coordinates. 2) set P of n2 points - let n = n1 + n2  For each point 'p' in set P, find the rectangle 'r_p' in set R that contains 'p'. If 'p' is not enclosed by any rectangle, then 'r_p' is undefined. Otherwise, 'r_p' is unique because of the non-overlapping set.  Goal: come up with a divide-and-conquer pseudocode to solve the general problem in O(n(logn)^2) time.  Asked about points that are on the edge of the rectangle, and they said it was up to me whether to include those or not, just a matter of "<" vs "<=", etc. comparisons. Because it's just pseudocode they were looking for, they were not too concerned with the actual structure of the return value, just that the D&C algorithm showed the logic.  Struggled with it for awhile and they simplified the problem to a ~special case with the constraint where all rectangles of R intersected a horizontal line 'L', and instead give a O(nlogn) algorithm to solve the same problem. I suspect this would've been a subproblem/subroutine of the more general case, but again got a bit lost.	0	0

Here we can have fileSystem or Database . I chose database . I will create simple DB schema of BucketNumber and word .  I will use buckets on main memory as cache , if we are not able to find a word in the bucket then query databse with bucket number and words then remove the least number times looked up word (every time we lookup a word we increament the count i.e value in key,value pair on hashtable) from that bucket and add this word .  I mentioned that bottleneck in this case will be every time a word is not present we need to query DB which usually has high latency which will result into performance hit  4) Lets say we are okay with latency but what if we are getting inserting words between that are only between only in two buckets ex. words starting from a and b only.

Every person is in some random floor. Initially lift is at floor 1 and all floors have single person. Problem here is.. we have to move the persons to their corresponding floor with minimum travelled distance of lift. Restriction : Lift can have at most one person at a time.  One more thing we have to think of is .. At a time, we can keep more than one person in a floor.. means, we don't necessarily need to take the person out from the floor if we keep another person on the same floor.	0	0				
173	admin	I Got this Crazy Question on PHONE INTERVIEW AT GOOGLE:  Design and implement a class to generate random numbers in an arbitrary probability distribution given by an array of integer weights, i.e. for int[] w return a number, n, from 0 to w.length - 1 with probability w[n] / sum(w). Using an existing random number generator with a uniform distribution is permitted.  Example distribution: w = 1, 2, 3, 2, 1  Example probabilities: w / sum = 1/9, 2/9, 1/3, 2/9, 1/9  Example results: n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4  Documentation:  Class java.util.Random  public int nextInt(int n)  Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive), drawn from this random number generator's sequence. The general contract of nextInt is that one int value in the specified range is pseudorandomly generated and returned. All n possible int values are produced with (approximately) equal probability.  Parameters: n - the bound on the random number to be returned. Must be positive. Returns: the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive) from this random number generator's sequence Throws: IllegalArgumentException - if n is not positive	0	0

184	admin	Had my first and second phone interview with Amazon. I was dropped. This site has been a great help towards my preparation and most questions are based on what you find here. Posting my Questions is a small way of saying Thanks!  Interview 1: 1. What is polymorphism. 2. Design an OO parking lot. What classes and functions will it have. It should say, full, empty and also be able to find spot for Valet parking. The lot has 3 different types of parking: regular, handicapped and compact. 3. Coding: I have an integer array where every number appears even number of times and only one appears odd times. Find the number. (I said hashtable and he asked me to write code with Hashtable) 4. What data structure would you use to look up phone numbers for customer names. (I said Hashtable. Asked why hashtable, why not a tree. I said HT has O(1). Asked is order always 1, when more than O(1) in HT.   Second Interview: 1. Starter: Describe your college projects. 2. OO Design: Design a deck of cards. What classes, data structures will you use? How will you shuffle the cards? How will you divide (deck) among players. What class/function do you need to denote players and where will you add them? What class/function do you need to deck? What if I need to add 2 jokers to the deck of 52 cards.  3. Data Structures: How will you use a hashtable to find data in a tree. (Then he rephrased) suppose I have a hashtable, I want to store the data in a tree instead of a bucket. How will I do it. What complexity to find an element.  4. Bits & Bytes: Find if a binary representation of a number is palindrome. The function should work irrespective of number of bytes for an integer. Suppose if our machine is 4 bytes for an int, how will you use the program for 8 byte machine.  5. Unix: Suppose I have 100's of html files in many directories. I want to find the files having phone numbers.  b) Suppose I have 2 files having phone numbers, find the repeating phone numbers. (I said sort and grep). Then he asked what if the lines cannot be sorted.  All the best guys. I think the second interview was challenging since the interviewer was prodding until he heard a leave me alone. So it means that though they are based on questions in cc, be prepared for extensions. I think this site is all you need to prepare for Amazon interview.	0	0

223	admin	There is a fictional company called fooBar in fooLand. The CEO of fooBar, fooMan, directs all managers to minimize the total hike that they give to employees, while ensuring that the hike is fair to them. Usually, this is done by giving more hike to employees who are rated better. So, for example, if an employee is rated 2 and is given hike 3x, an employee rated 3 should be given a hike greater than 3x. Hikes are always in multiples of x only and the minimum hike to be given to any employee is x.  This year, however, a wicked manager, barMan comes up with a brilliant strategy. He assumes that each employee would get to know the hike of only the two employees who sit next to him (one on the left, one on the right). And therefore, he reasons(using whole of his analytical left brain), that as long as he could make hikes fair for each employee with respect to the two employees that sit next to him, he would fulfill the dual objective of being "fair" as well as minimizing the total hike given. Just for clarification, the employees of each team sit in one big line.  barMan hires you to calculate the hike to be given to each employee. Over to you. You are supposed to come up with the total hike number that will excite barMan and make him roll on the floor laughing. You are given that no two employee sitting next to each other would have a common rating.  Input:  The order of rating of each employee should be in the order in which they sit. First line will be the value of x. The second line will be the number of employees 'n'. The next 'n' lines specify the rating of each employee. Rating can be integers from 1 to 105. (weird, right?)  1 <= n <= 105. 1 <= x <= 104.  Sample input 1:  10 4 1 4 6 2  Output: 70  Why? If we have the hikes as first employee gets 10, second gets 20, third gets 30 and fourth gets 10, we satisfy all our constraints.	0	0

228	admin	Starting at the 0 (zero) index, you need to "jump" through a one-dimensional array (zero based index) of true/false values. True is a place you can land on (if desired) and false is a place you must jump over (cannot land on). The array can be very very long.  Your "velocity" indicates how many spots (or array indexes) you advance with every jump. For example, if you have a velocity of 2 and are currently at index 4, after the jump, you will be at index 6. Before each jump you can increase your velocity by 1, decrease your velocity by 1, or keep the same velocity. You can only go forwards.  You start at index 0 (zero), with a velocity of 1. This means that for the very first jump, you can keep the same velocity and move to index 1, or increase velocity by 1 (to a velocity of 2) to move to index 2. On this first jump, you can't decrease your velocity as that would make your velocity 0 (zero) and you wouldn't move. Now that you've jumped, you can again increase, decrease, or keep your velocity the same, then jump again.  As an example, let's say you increased your velocity to 2 and jumped. You're now at index 2 with a velocity of 2. You can: 1) decrease your velocity to 1 and jump to index 3. 2) keep your velocity at 2 and jump to index 4. 3) increase your velocity to 3 and jump to index 5.  Remember, you can only and on an index if it's "true". You are successful if you can get past the last index.

304	admin	Consider this string representation for binary trees. Each node is of the form (lr), where l represents the left child and r represents the right child. If l is the character 0, then there is no left child. Similarly, if r is the character 0, then there is no right child. Otherwise, the child can be a node of the form (lr), and the representation continues recursively. For example: (00) is a tree that consists of one node. ((00)0) is a two-node tree in which the root has a left child, and the left child is a leaf. And ((00)(00)) is a three-node tree, with a root, a left and a right child.  Write a function that takes as input such a string, and returns -1 if the string is malformed, and the depth of the tree if the string is well-formed.

360	admin	Engineers at Google have decided to call any integer (+ve, -ve or 0) that is divisible by at least one of the single digit primes (2, 3, 5, 7) as Walprimes. Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes. Now, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime. Your task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes. Input format: (Read from stdin) The first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases. Each of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime. Output format: (Write to stdout) Output exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007. Sample testcase: Input: 2 011 12345 Output: 6 64 Explanation: For the first test case, s = "011". There are 32 = 9 valid expressions that can be formed from this string, namely {0+11, 0-11, 0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1, 011} . Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}. Constraints: There are 3 data sets. For the first data set (5 points) - 1 For the second data set (10 points) - 1 For the third data set (15 points) - 1	0	0

For example, at the top level, there would just be one glass, at the second level there would be three, then 6 and then 10 and so on and so forth like the following image  .  The glasses are numbered using 2 numbers, L and N. L represents the level of the glass and N represents the number in that level. Numbers in a given level are as follows:  Level 1: 1  Level 2: 1 2 3  Level 3: 1 2 3 4 5 6  Level 4: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10   Each glass can hold 250ml of wine. The bartender comes and starts pouring wine in the top glass(The glass numbered L = 1 and N = 1) from bottles each of capacity 750ml.  As wine is poured in the glasses, once a glass gets full, it overflows equally into the 3 glasses on the next level below it and touching it, without any wine being spilled outside. It doesn't overflow to the glasses on the same level beside it. It also doesn't overflow to the any level below next level (directly).  For example: When the glass of L = 2 and N = 2 overflows, the water will overflow to glasses of L = 3 and N = 2, 4, 5.  Once that the bartender is done pouring B bottles, figure out how much quantity in ml of wine is present in the glass on level L with glass number N. Input  The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three integers, B, L, N, B is the number of bottles the bartender pours and L is the glass level in the pyramid and N is the number of the glass in that level. Output  For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the quantity of wine in ml in that glass.	0	0

I must be able to tell, from what is returned, if the position is reachable or not and if reachable I must be able to trace the path from given position to target position   <<FOLLOW-UP>> For example if 4 cells are reachable from a cell A, then these 4 cells become children of A. Then from a cell, say B, out of these 4 cells, you can reach 2 more cells: C and D. Then C and D become children of B. Likewise program need to return me a DS.

523	admin	We have a list of N nodes with each node pointing to one of the N nodes. It could even be pointing to itself. We call a node good, if it satisfies one of the following properties:  * It is the tail node (marked as node 1) * It is pointing to the tail node (node 1) * It is pointing to a good node  You can change the pointers of some nodes in order to make them all good. You are given the description of the nodes. You have to find out what is minimum number of nodes that you have to change in order to make all the nodes good.  Input: The first line of input contains an integer number N which is the number of nodes. The next N lines contains N numbers, all between 1 and N. The first number, is the number of the node pointed to by Node 1; the second number is the number of the node pointed to by Node 2; the third number is the number of the node pointed to by Node 3 and so on.  N is no larger than 1000.  Output: Print a single integer which is the answer to the problem  Sample Input 1: 5 1 2 3 4 5  Sample output 1: 4  Explanation: We have to change pointers for four nodes (node #2 to node #5) to point to node #1. Thus 4 changes are required  Sample input 2: 5 5 5 5 5 5  Sample output 2: 1  Explanation: We have to just change node #5 to point to node #1 (tail node) which will make node #5 good. Since all the other nodes point to a good node (node #5), every node becomes a good node.	0	0

525	admin	There is an old dry well. Its sides are made of concrete rings. Each such ring is one meter high, but the rings can have different (internal) diameters. Nevertheless, all the rings are centered on one another. The well is N meters deep; that is, there are N concrete rings inside it. You are about to drop M concrete disks into the well. Each disk is one meter thick, and different disks can have different diameters. Once each disk is dropped, it falls down until: * it hits the bottom of the well; * it hits a ring whose internal diameter is smaller then the disk's diameter; or * it hits a previously dropped disk. (Note that if the internal diameter of a ring and the diameter of a disk are equal, then the disk can fall through the ring.) The disks you are about to drop are ready and you know their diameters, as well as the diameters of all the rings in the well. The question arises: how many of the disks will fit into the well? Write a function: class Solution { int falling_disks(int[] A,int[] B); } that, given two zero-indexed arrays of integers  A, containing the internal diameters of the N rings (in top-down order), and B, containing the diameters of the M disks (in the order they are to be dropped)  returns the number of disks that will fit into the well. For example, given the following two arrays: A[0] = 5 B[0] = 2 A[1] = 6 B[1] = 3 A[2] = 4 B[2] = 5 A[3] = 3 B[3] = 2 A[4] = 6 B[4] = 4 A[5] = 2 A[6] = 3 the function should return 4, as all but the last of the disks will fit into the well. The figure shows the situation after dropping four disks.  Assume that: N is an integer within the range [1..200,000]; M is an integer within the range [1..200,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000]; each element of array B is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000]. Complexity: expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments). Elements of input arrays can be modified.	0	0

Unfortunately the number in some of the cells has been erased. We want to write a number to those cells such that the resultant rectangle has all the numbers between 1 to n*m and it contains as many important cells as possible. In case there are several ways to do that, we are interested with the rectangle which is lexicographically smallest. A table is lexicographically smaller that the other if the string of its row-major view is lexicographically smaller than the other. Input: The first line of the input contains two integers n and m, Each of the next n lines contains m tokens. Each token is either an integer between 1 and n*m or '?'.

Thus, it is possible, for example, to buy exactly 15 McNuggets (with one package of 6 and a second package of 9), but it is not possible to buy exactly 16 McNuggets, since no non- negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's add up to 16. To determine if it is possible to buy exactly n McNuggets, one has to find non-negative integer values of a, b, and c such that 6a+9b+20c=n Write a function, called McNuggets that takes one argument, n, and returns True if it is possible to buy a combination of 6, 9 and 20 pack units such that the total number of McNuggets equals n, and otherwise returns False.

596	admin	It was a pretty interesting question.  Assume that you are given a fixed set of floating point numbers. Now given a new floating point number 'x', the goal is to efficiently find the number that is closest to 'x' from the fixed set. Question is: what data structure will you actually use for storing the fixed set of floating point numbers to achieve this?  Edit: I missed to add. The interviewer further mentioned that I can not sort and that I can use any amount of time for creating the data structure (meaning this need not be efficient).  Since, I am not allowed to 'sort', I assumed that I can not use BST as I will have to compare numbers while populating the tree. But I didn't clarify it with him; I should have in hindsight.	0	0

703	admin	Rakesh likes skiing a lot. That's not very surprising, since skiing is really great. The problem with skiing is one have to slide downwards to gain speed. Also when reached the bottom most point one has to wait for ski-lift to get to higher altitude.  Rakesh seeks your help to know the longest run possible with the given peaks. That altitude of different peaks is given by a grid of numbers. Look at this example:  7 2 3 4 5 36 37 38 34 6 33 44 46 40 7 24 43 42 41 8 35 32 47 30 9  One can ski down from one peak to a connected peak if and only if the height decreases. One peak is connected to another if it's at left, at right, above or below it. In the sample map, a possible ski path would be 36-33-24(start at 36, end at 24). Of course if one would ski 46-44-43-42-41-30-9....3-2, it would be a much longer run. In fact, it's the longest possible. There could be more than one longest ski path, but all Rakesh needs from you is to tell maximum number of peaks he could cover for a given map, in this case it is 14.  Input :: All input comes from input.txt file. The first line contains the number of test cases N. Each test case starts with a line containing the name (it's a single string), the number of rows R and the number of columns C. After that follow R lines with C numbers each, defining the heights. R and C won't be bigger than 100.  Output :: For each test case, print a line to output.txt containing the name of the area, a colon, a space and the length of the longest run (maximum points covered) one can slide down in that area.  Sample Input 2 Manali 10 5 56 14 51 58 88 26 94 24 39 41 24 16 8 51 51 76 72 77 43 10 38 50 59 84 81 5 23 37 71 77 96 10 93 53 82 94 15 96 69 9 74 0 62 38 96 37 54 55 82 38 Narkanda 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 16 17 18 19 6 15 24 25 20 7 14 23 22 21 8 13 12 11 10 9  Sample Output Manali: 7 Narkanda: 25	0	0

Ans > I answered this one saying we have max variable and min variable defined in the stack. Whenever we push any number into stack, we compare with the current max and update, if necessary. Same with min.  Q > Then, he asked me what happens when we pop ? If the element to be popped is the max element, how do we find the second max to be the new max element.  Ans > This, i answered we maintain two different stacks inside a stack called maxStack and minStack for max and min elements. He asked me to code everything. I did.  Then, he asked me if there are duplicates in the stack, can we optimise our solution so that the max element doesn't get inserted into the maxStack more than once and still we get all the above functionalities in optimised way ?  Ans > I answered we maintain a map of integer and it count. When we push into the stack, if the element is already there in the stack, we increase its count and update the maxStack or minStack, if necessary. When we pop, we decrease the count. If count becomes 0, then we update the maxStack and minStack, if necessary.  I coded everything then.	0	0

You want to move all objects belonging to the same group to the same position. Objects in two different groups may be placed at the same position. What is the minimum total amount by which you need to move the objects to accomplish this?  Input: The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. The first line contains N and K. The next line contains N space seperated integers, denoting the original positions x_i of the objects.  Output: Output T lines, containing the total minimum amount by which the objects should be moved.  Constraints: 1 <= T <= 1000 1 <= K <= N <= 200 0 <= x_i <= 1000  Sample Input: 3 3 3 1 1 3 3 2 1 2 4 4 2 1 2 5 7  Sample Output: 0 1 3  Explanation:  For the first case, there is no need to move any object. For the second case, group objects 1 and 2 together by moving the first object to position 2. For the third case, group objects 1 and 2 together by moving the first object to position 2 and group objects 3 and 4 together by moving object 3 to position 7. Thus the answer is 1 + 2 = 3.	0	0

They are scared and want to get inside holes to ensure their safety. Mice and holes are placed on a straight line. There are m holes on this line. Each hole can accommodate only 1 mouse. A mouse can either stay at its position, or move one step right from x to x+1, or move one step left from x to x-1. Any of these movements takes 1 minute. Assign mice to holes so that the time required for all the mice to move inside the holes is minimized.  Input Format The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T blocks of input:  First line contains 2 positive integers n and m separated by a single space. Next line contains n space separated integers, denoting the positions of the mice. Next line contains m space separated integers, denoting the positions of the holes. Note: No two holes have the same position.

Most of the bar codes differ only in 1 or 2 bits. So we can only put an item into other bag if it has more than 2 differing bits from all the other items of that bag. Find no. of bags needed. INPUT : First line contains two space separated integers, N and B. N : no of items to be carried, B : length of each bar code. Next N lines each contain B space separated integers (0's and 1's only) denoting Bar Code of corresponding items.  OUTPUT : Minimum no. of bags required.

At times when typing users may enter a query string which may be single word by mistake but the intention of the user was to type them separately. For eg.,  User may have entered flipkartmobile when in real, his / her intention was to search for flip kart mobile.  Considering above scenario, implement an algorithm to split up query string provided by user given a list of dictionary words, i.e, you will be given a list of dictionary words and the user-input query string and you have to give the split up of query string which satisfies the following requirements / properties : 1. In case of multiple split-ups, conclude on the one that is lexicographically smaller, i.e, has spaces more towards the left. For eg.,  Assume you are given the list of words : flip, kart, flipkart, mobile and user-input query string is flipkartmobile. Hence, possible split-ups are flip kart mobile and flipkart mobile. The answer / output in this case should be flip kart mobile with more spaces towards the left.  2. Number of characters in query string shall be < 500 characters. Reason being hackers may try to provide a very long input and hence, this may consume processing and result in unresponsive website ultimately.  3. Repetition of dictionary words in query string is possible. For eg.,  Assume you are given the list of words : lg, mobile and user-input query string is mobilelglg. The answer / output in this case should be mobile lg lg.  Now, format of Input and Output : Input 4 // number of dictionary words given flip // list of dictionary words the number equaling to input above kart flipkartmobile flipkartmobile // user-input query string  Output flip kart mobile	0	0

914	admin	You want to create a staff to use in your martial arts training, and it has to meet some specific requirements.  1. You want it to be composed of two smaller staves of equal length so that you can either use it as a single staff or as two smaller ones.  2. You want the full sized staff's center of gravity to be exactly in the middle of the staff.  You have a very, very long branch from which you can cut the pieces for your staff. The mass of the branch varies significantly throughout it, so you use just any two pieces of the same length. Given a description of the mass throughout the branch, determine the longest staff you can make, then return three integers on a single line, the first two indicating the first index of each half-staff, and the third indicating the length of each half-staff.  The input will be given on a single line as a string of digits [1-9], each digit representing the mass of a section of the branch. All sections are the same size and the maximum length of the string is 500. Here is an example:  41111921111119 11119 11119  If the indicated sections are cut from the branch they will satisfy your requirements. They are both the same length, and they can be put together as either 9111111119 or 1111991111, both of which have a center of gravity exactly in the center of the staff.   Center of gravity can be determined by taking a weighted average of the mass of each section of the staff. Given the following distances and masses: Distance: 12345678 Mass: 22241211  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 15 Weighted sum of the masses: 2*1 + 2*2 + 2*3 + 4*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 1*7 + 1*8 = 60 Weighted sum / regular sum = 60 / 15 = 4  This means that the center of mass is in section 4 of the staff. If we wanted to use this staff the center of gravity would need to be (8+1)/2 = 4.5.  Here is an example problem:  131251141231 ---- ----  If we take the sections indicated we get 1312 and 1231. By reversing the first one and putting them together we get 21311231  Sum of the mass of each section: 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14 Weight sum of the masses: 2*1 + 1*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 1*8 = 63 Weighted sum / regular sum = 63 / 14 = 4.5  This puts the center of mass exactly in the center of the staff, for a perfectly balanced staff. There isn't a longer staff that can be made from this, so the answer to this problem is  0 8 4  Because the half-staves begin at indices 0 and 8 (in that order) and each is of length 4.	0	0

935	admin	Liar, Liar As a newbie on a particular internet discussion board, you notice a distinct trend among its veteran members; everyone seems to be either unfailingly honest or compulsively deceptive. You decide to try to identify the members of the two groups, starting with the assumption that every senior member either never lies or never tells the truth. You compile as much data as possible, asking each person for a list of which people are liars. Since the people you are asking have been around on the board for a long time, you may assume that they have perfect knowledge of who is trustworthy and who is not. Each person will respond with a list of people that they accuse of being liars. Everyone on the board can see that you are a tremendous n00b, so they will grudgingly give you only partial lists of who the liars are. Of course these lists are not to be taken at face value because of all the lying going on.  You must write a program to determine, given all the information you've collected from the discussion board members, which members have the same attitude toward telling the truth. It's a pretty popular discussion board, so your program will need to be able to process a large amount of data quickly and efficiently.   Input Specifications Your program must take a single command line argument; the name of a file. It must then open the file and read out the input data. The data begins with the number of veteran members n followed by a newline. It continues with n chunks of information, each defining the accusations made by a single member. Each chunk is formatted as follows:  <accuser name> <m>  followed by m lines each containing the name of one member that the accuser says is a liar. accuser name and m are separated by some number of tabs and spaces. m will always be in [0, n]. All member names contain only alphabetic characters and are unique and case-sensitive.  Example input file:  5 Stephen 1 Tommaso Tommaso 1 Galileo Isaac 1 Tommaso Galileo 1 Tommaso George 2 Isaac Stephen     Output Specifications Your output must consist of two numbers separated by a single space and followed by a newline, printed to standard out. The first number is the size of the larger group between the liars and the non-liars. The second number is the size of the smaller group. You are guaranteed that exactly one correct solution exists for all test data.  Example output: 3 2	0	0

959	admin	You are given an array of size N containing negative and positive real numbers. Zero may or may not be present in the array. The requirement is to rearrange the array using O(N) time and O(1) space so that all negative numbers come before all positive elements. Develop a program to read a real number array of size N from user, and then arrange it as explained above. Constraints : (i) The value of N has to be read from user, and the memory for array has to be allocated dynamically. The real numbers will be also read from user. The menu-driven program should also have an option to populate the array with random data, if the user wants to do so. (ii) A maximum of 3 passes allowed over the entire array. O(N) time expected. (iii) O(1) extra space permitted  creating copy of array etc not allowed. (iv) Program must work properly even if zero is NOT present in array.	0	0

967	admin	A new Kindle feature is being developed to rank customers based on their reading speed.  A customer's "reading speed" is the maximum number of pages they have read in a single minute over the previous 10 minutes. Every minute, we will log the customer's current page, which can be used to calculate this speed. For example: Current Time: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15] Current Page: [0, 5, 6, 8,12,15,17,21,24,27,29,31,37,42,49,52] Current Speed: [0, 5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 6, 5, 7, 3] "Reading Speed": [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 6, 6, 7, 7]  We want to produce separate leaderboards for each book. Each customer will only read one book at a time, but multiple customers may read the same book.  Every minute, the "updateReadingSpeeds" method will be called to report each customer's reading progress. Please implement this method:  void updateReadingSpeeds(String customerID, String bookID, int pageNumber)  At any time, we should be able to request the full leaderboard for any book. Please implement the "printLeaderboard" method:  void printLeaderboard(String bookID)  The output should be CSV printed to standard output, like:  Customer ID,Reading Speed,Rank Customer 1,5,1 Customer 3,4,2 Customer 2,4,3 Customer 5,2,4  *The updateReadingSpeeds method will be called every minute for every customer. *CustomerID will uniquely identify a customer, bookID will uniquely identify a book *Page numbers are integers between 0 and 1000000, and will never decrease over time. *Customers who "tie" with the same reading speed can be ranked in any order.	0	0

1045	admin	One of the many ways of representing a tree is to have an array(of length same as number of nodes), where each element in the node denotes the parent of that node. Eg - {-1, 0, 0, 1, 1} would represent a tree with - * 0 as root * 1 and 2 as children of 0 * 3 and 4 as children of 1  Given a similar representation, you have to print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree. Level order traversal of a tree is where we traverse levels of tree one by one.  Eg - For the above given tree, level order traversal would be - 0 1 2 3 4 And hence, the reverse level order traversal is - 3 4 1 2 0 Please note - * An element with parent = -1 is the root element. * An element with the least index becomes the left most child. (ie. a node with always be on left of all its siblings that have higher index than it) * When printing a level of tree you need to maintain left to right order.  Input Format - First line of the input contains number of nodes in the tree (N) Next line contains N (space seperated) numbers that denote where i-th number will denote the parent node of i-th node.  Output Format - Print reverse level order traversal of the corresponding tree, with every new level starting in a different line. Notes/Limits - * 1 <= N <= 50 * There will be only one root element in any given test case * Given numbers will always form a valid undivided tree * Output should be in the exact format as specified (including whitespaces) Sample Test Cases - Input - 5 -1 0 0 2 1 Output - 4 3 1 2 0  Input - 9 8 7 0 5 5 8 7 0 -1 Output - 1 6 2 7 3 4 0 5 8 Input - 45 24 42 4 30 29 43 22 15 26 36 26 16 3 22 21 41 18 16 34 41 12 29 32 30 43 15 4 38 36 -1 24 42 18 6 21 38 6 17 32 17 3 34 12 14 14 Output - 1 31 20 42 9 28 12 40 33 36 3 23 37 39 6 13 27 35 0 30 11 17 22 38 7 25 5 24 16 32 15 19 8 10 43 44 18 41 2 26 14 34 4 21 29  Input - 33 17 25 0 14 7 2 5 25 18 8 16 27 10 9 19 7 31 31 19 0 8 14 9 17 18 2 30 16 30 10 5 -1 27 Output - 13 22 26 28 4 15 9 20 6 30 1 7 3 21 8 24 5 25 14 18 12 29 11 32 2 19 10 27 0 23 16 17 31	0	0

1047	admin	Stakeout  Congratulations! You are the new elite hacker in a group of villainous ne'er-do-wells.  Luckily this group is more saavy than your last band of ruffians, and they are looking to software (and you) to improve their take. The con man for the team, has gone door-to-door down each street posing as a termite inspector so he could covertly total the valuable goods in each house. Normally the gang would just rob all the valuable homes, but there's a catch! Whenever a house is robbed in this wealthy neighborhood, the police watch it and the neighboring houses for months.  So the gang can't simply rob all the homes, and if they choose to rob one, they can no longer rob the house on either side of it.

1160	admin	Write a method in Java to: Find all set of permutations from N number of ArrayLists. Each ArrayList has a different length. Each permutation is formed by picking one item from each input ArrayList. You have to exhaust ALL permutations. Each permutation is a Set, so the order of the items does not matter. For example [a1,b1,c1] is the same permutation as [c1,b1,a1].  Example:  Input: N number of array lists with different length [a1,a2,a3....] [b1,b2....] [c1, c2... ]  ... Output: ALL permutations [a1, b1, c1...], [a1,b1,c2..] .... Note: The above example is just a sample of potential input to illustrate the output. You have to write code to solve for generalized input.	0	0

1172	admin	First the interviewer have called me on time, he introduced himself and his project which takes about 10 minutes, then he asked me why do you want to join facebook.. Then he started in the technical questions, the first questions was: he described to me a game called othelo (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) which is a 2 player board game using for example X and O, if player X placed X in an empty space _OOOX the O's between the two X's will be converted to X XOOOX ==> XXXXX this will happen on the current row, column, and the two diagonals in every directions and if the following case happened __OOX and the X player placed X in the first space X_OOX nothing occured for the two Os  given a certain state of the board, location on the board, a certain piece to place on the given location  update the board, and make the required validations  Then I started to code the required method, then have revised it and fixed small bugs, then he told me that it seems to be working.  then we turned to the second question: which is given a Collection<String> words, return a Collection<String> of anagrams found in the given collection for example "The rat fell in the tar" => returned [rat tar]  Then I have discussed him in an algorithm with O(n k lg k) where n is the number of words and k is the average length of the word, then I started to code it and then he said that it seems to be working.  then the interview is finished.  Notes: * Try to practice a lot before the interview, by solving such problems and try to mimic the interview environment by coding in the collabedit.com text editor * Don't use Ctrl + S while coding in collabedit as it may lead to some problems. * Don't be afraid before the interview, just calm down as the interviewers are very friendly.

1181	admin	Coding Round Assignment ------------------------------------  MERCHANT'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY  You decided to give up on earth after the latest financial collapse left 99.99% of the earth's population with 0.01% of the wealth. Luckily, with the scant sum of money that is left in your account, you are able to afford to rent a spaceship, leave earth, and fly all over the galaxy to sell common metals and dirt (which apparently is worth a lot).Buying and selling over the galaxy requires you to convert numbers and units, and you decided to write a program to help you.The numbers used for intergalactic transactions follows similar convention to the roman numerals and you have painstakingly collected the appropriate translation between them.Roman numerals are based on seven symbols:  Symbol Value I 1 V 5 X 10 L 50 C 100 D 500 M 1,000 Numbers are formed by combining symbols together and adding the values. For example, MMVI is 1000 + 1000 + 5 + 1 = 2006. Generally, symbols are placed in order of value, starting with the largest values. When smaller values precede larger values, the smaller values are subtracted from the larger values, and the result is added to the total. For example MCMXLIV = 1000 + (1000  100) + (50  10) + (5  1) = 1944. The symbols "I", "X", "C", and "M" can be repeated three times in succession, but no more. (They may appear four times if the third and fourth are separated by a smaller value, such as XXXIX.) "D", "L", and "V" can never be repeated. "I" can be subtracted from "V" and "X" only. "X" can be subtracted from "L" and "C" only. "C" can be subtracted from "D" and "M" only. "V", "L", and "D" can never be subtracted. Only one small-value symbol may be subtracted from any large-value symbol. A number written in Arabic numerals can be broken into digits. For example, 1903 is composed of 1, 9, 0, and 3. To write the Roman numeral, each of the non-zero digits should be treated separately. In the above example, 1,000 = M, 900 = CM, and 3 = III. Therefore, 1903 = MCMIII. -- Source: Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)Input to your program consists of lines of text detailing your notes on the conversion between intergalactic units and roman numerals.

1190	admin	Problem Statement There are three types of tickets and stations available in CodeCountry A, B and C. Tickets of type A can only be bought at stations of type A and end at a station of type B. Tickets of type B can only be bought at stations of type B and end at a station of type C. Similarly, tickets of type C can only be bought at stations of type C and end at a station of type A. Also, you can only travel from station i to station j if j > i, i.e. you can only move forward and if the ticket type bought at station i ends at station j. The cost of a ticket is j x j if you travel a distance of j. For example if you start at Station 3 and end at station 5 the cost is 2 x 2=4. Now, you want to travel from Station 1 to Station N using trains in CodeCountry. You are given the type of each station. Output the minimum cost of the journey. Note that station N will also have a type and you must reach it using a ticket of compatible type. Output -1 if it is not possible to reach from station 1 to station N  Input Format The first line contains the number of test cases T. This is followed by T lines one for each test case. Each test case consists of a string representing the types of each station. The i-th character of the string represents the i-th station's type.  Output Format Output the minimum cost of the journey, one line per test case.  Constraints The number of test cases is atmost 50. There will be atleast 2 stations and atmost 15 stations. The first station (station 1) is always of type A.	0	0

1196	admin	Highly coupled code is code where the dependencies between classes are dense, lots of things depend on other things. This kind of program is hard to understand, tough to maintain, and tends to be fragile, breaking easily when things change. Simplistically, we can say that class A is statically coupled to class B if the compiler needs the definition of B in order to compile class A. Moreover dependencies among them are transitive. That is if A depends on B and B depends on C, then A also depends on C Create a program logic/pseudo code which can print the "expanded dependency tree" given a set of input per class dependencies. Make sure that there are no duplicates in the output Input A -> B,C B->C,E C->G D->A,F E->F F->H Output A depends on B C E F G H B depends on C E F G H C depends on G D depends on A B C E F G H E depends on F H F depends on H	0	0
